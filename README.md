# WaveForms Scripts

These scripts are meant for the [Digilent WaveForms](https://store.digilentinc.com/waveforms-download-only/) software.

The Scripts are primarily developed for the Digilent AnalogDiscovery2 with the BNC Adapter. 

## Disclaimer
This project is not associated with Digilent. I am not sponsored and/or a partner / employee of Digilent.

I also take no responsibility for damages that might occur when using these scripts. Use them at your own risk.

The scripts are nor meant for commercial purposes, I allow usage for commercial purposes, but won't give any guarantee. 

## Usage
1. You need a WaveForms compatible device. I use a Digilent AnalogDiscovery2 with the BNC Adapter.
2. Download the latest version of Digilent WaveForms from the [official Website](https://store.digilentinc.com/waveforms-download-only/).
3. Open WaveForms and open a Script Tab by choosing "Script" in the menu on the left side of the "Welcome"-Screen.
4. Copy & Paste the content of the Script (depending on what script you want to use) in the Script editor.
5. Follow the comments/instructions inside the script and setup the software and run it.

## Scripts
Current Scripts:
* ``Capacitance.js`` - (NOT TESTED!) Is a script to automatically measure and calculate the capacitance of a unpolarized capacitor in an RC (Resistor-Capacitor) voltage divider.
* ``Inductance.js`` - Is a script to automatically measure and calculate the inductance of an inductor in an RL (Resistor-Inductor) voltage divider.

## Addendum
You can post issues and pull-requests, and while I will look at them and might fix some issues and accept pull requests, it is not a project I will take much care of.
They are mostly written by me for me, so I will not modify them for a more general use case and I will most likely not take requests for scripts.

Feel free to fork the project and issue pull-requests if you think a script can be improved.
